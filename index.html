                    <p>
                        I became very interested in ThreeJS when I discovered that the library had support for VR gears.
                        I thought, why not make a personal world instead of a personal website, like in those weird
                        japan animes? This "Hello World" experiment with ThreeJs showed me that the learning curve with
                        this library is very gentle. It's easy to do anything with ThreeJS, just read the documentions!
                        It's very well documented, and there's PLENTY examples to reverse-engineer for whatever you
                        need!

                    <p>
                        On a whim, I decided to try to find a way to arrange texts into a circle.
                        I thought it would be easy... It wasn't easy at all! Some trigonometry was
                        required to arrange everything into circle. The result of this miniproject
                        is that I now have a very easily reuseable snippet of code that can arrange
                        anything into circles... If I wanted to, I could make it recursive, circles all
                        the way down and up!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I've used the circle snippet I made when redoing one of my old course homeworks for fun, see

                    <h2>Checkbox Hack</h2>
                    <p>
                        I heard that by cheesing how HTML and CSS works, you can make onclick-like
                        events to occur without using any scripting languages. This miniproject is
                        my attempt at the checkbox hack.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The checkbox hack is a VERY interesting approach to accessibility. It's bad
                        semantics, but it's very dobable to design websites that fake onclick events
                        by using the checkbox hacks. The main drawback is that it will not degrace
                        gracefully when used in older browsers... Instead of degrading in any ways,
                        it would just break, completely!

                    <h2>Moving Popup</h2>
                    <p>
                        I was inspired by a random attack by randsomwares and annoying pop-ups on a
                        website to see how annoying I could make those pop-ups to be! What I came up
                        with is a pop-up that, soon as it's spawned, start running around the screen
                        making it very frustrating to try to close the pop-up.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One big thing I learned from this miniproject was that pop-ups can only be
                        triggered by the client's actions, limited to a single pop-up per action, so
                        you can't for example, cause thousands of pop-ups to appear on a single click.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I found a few ways to completely lock up the browser in a way where the task
                        manager is needed to kill the browser... Because that vector of attack is so
                        annoying, I'm not posting it here! The one I'm making public is harmless, you
                        can stop the pop-up window from moving by closing the website page that spawned
                        the pop-up.

                                This project was an exercise in dynamic programming. The goal was to make something that
                                would change based on the choices the user makes. I went way overboard by deciding to
                                turn
                                an .ebook into easily parseable JSON for a javaScript engine I made to work with text
                                adventure books! It will work with any text adventure book long as the input is the
                                JSONified book.
                            </p>
                            <p>For the book I selected, it was pretty fun finally "playing" the book after porting it
                                over. I didn't read a single thing in the book when figuring out how to easily jsonifity
                                it. If I had to redo the project, there is a ton of things I would be able to do better.
                                Sadly, an adventure book parser/player thingy isn't THAT cool!</p>

                        awesome!
                        It made making this goofy site very easy! I didn't have to worry about screen sizes, etc...
                        Flex takes
                        care of all of that!

                        I made this prototype a long time ago when someone asked me if
                        I could get more infomation about their vistors without using
                        third-party scripts. It was much easier than I expected. I did
                        it in both PHP and JavaScript. With PHP, it was much easier to
                        extract infomation about visters, and it was easy to set the script
                        to email me asking me to update it when it encounters a new type of
                        browser and devices.

                        Design a custom website that uses Steam's APIs to make a better search engine. Steam's GUIs are
                        very basic, and lacks a lot of functions... Due to that, it can be hard to find new and
                        interesting games that you haven't already seen. I've dug up a few too much overlooked gems to
                        not consider attempting to design something better.
