The reason I chose this story for my final demo to get the point across that my program works quite well with Choose your own adventure books of any sizes is that the design of this story was a odd one. The story looped around within itself.

I saw how annoying that would be to keep on going back to the same page after turning to the other end of the book repeatly, and so, imported it into my program.

However, one thing I failed to account for was how the story used the notebook. Clues and check-boxes. When I noticed how it was handling those, it was far too late for me to add an new datafield to my page objects to get the page-loader function to display options depending on what you've put into the notebook, and what boxes you've already checked.
