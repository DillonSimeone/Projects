            <h1>About Us</h1>
        </header>
        <p>We are a group of motivated Cottage Grovers consisting of over 2,000 patriots whose main focus today isn't
            American Idol or NCAA Sweet 16. We are consumed to reclaim our country from a minority of Progressives
            who've managed to wrest control of our American culture and government from the likes of George Washington,
            Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson.</p>
        <p>The group aims to be nonpartisan — unaffiliated with any political party, Anthony said, who is a retired
            contractor and has lived in Cottage Grove for 25 years.

            The Project is largely self-funded, aside from profits made from raffle tickets and community donations.
            There are seven members on the board. Generally, 25 to 30 attendees show up for the meetings, and many of
            them have been the core group for several years. </p>

        <p>The doors are open to everyone and the idea is to appeal to all age groups, Duffy said.</p>

        <p>The 912 Project has support from several community organizations, such as Sustainable Cottage Grove, a group
            that hosts food preservation workshops, lectures on healthy eating and teaches self-sustainability. </p>
