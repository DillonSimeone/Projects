CopyPaste is an auto hot key script I made that aided me with quickly importing the whole book into my final demo for my Project 1 program. What it does is to make it so I didn't have to abuse my pinky finger by pressing control thousands of time to copy/cut/paste/select all/Enter - tab.

(If you don't have autoHotKey installed... Install it now! AHK is the best thing ever, it works for everything! You can put in sleeps between key sends, etc, and make marcos that works for video games and whatever!)

PAGETemplateCreator is a php script I made that made the blank object templates, which saved me hours of time.

I tried to automate what I was doing with the .PDF, but sadly, the formatting completely broke any scripts I thought of. So I had to do it by hand. I ended up doing 50 pages a day, which takes me about 45 minutes each day due to me double checking that I haven't made any errors after popping in a page. I would wake up, get some coffee and get to pounding my keyboards for 45 minutes straight without stop when sipping from my cup.

I'm happy to say that my time management paid off! I didn't kill myself pulling this project together, I used the time I would had used for homeworks to import the whole book into my program after determining that it works perfectly with smaller adventure stories.
