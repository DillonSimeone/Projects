			<h1>Web 2</h1>
			<p>
				WARNING: Most of the stuff here that uses PHP scripts are broken. I'm not sure what exactly caused scripts that used to work to suddenly stop working. Far as I can tell, variable scrops have changed. It seems that I no longer can declare a variable outside of a function and access that variable from within the function. It also seems that variable scopes are now limited to each PHP sections, which breaks my group project to a point where rewriting the whole thing would be easier. I'm still unable to pinlocate when exactly this happened.

			<h2>Web 2 Projects</h2>
				<div>
					<h3><a href="https://people.rit.edu/dys8701/Practical/web2/Projects/GroupFinalProject/index.php">Squiggly Doodlefluffers: Group Final Project</a></h3>
					<p>This project was very frustrating. To find out why, go to the About page. The other group members was not able to do their jobs, so I ended up taking over their tasks, then before I knew it, I'm doing the project solo. </p>
					<p>
						ToDo: Figure out why Session_Start(); is no longer working, and set up a new MySQL database for the account system. It seems to be releated to the Scope. Need to make more prototypes to try to force the same error to occur in a smaller testing area so it's easier to track it down.

					<h3><a href="https://people.rit.edu/dys8701/Practical/web2/Projects/IndividualFinalProject/">Individual Final Project</a></h3>
					<p>A trainwreck! The group members in the group project managed to draw my attention away from my individual project long enough that by the time I finally finished up everyone's work for them, I didn't have any chance to rest before working on this project. I was quite burnt out at the time.</p>
					<p>It's bad. Bad enough that I am tempted to just delete it and pretend that it never happened.</p>
