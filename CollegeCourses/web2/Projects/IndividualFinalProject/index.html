            Dragon's Dogma is an single-player action role-playing video game made and published by Capcom. This game is very unique in how it features an open-world setting along with hack and slash gameplay! The combat in the game is completely dynamic, you can climb orges to stab them in their eyes,  or ride atop a griffin when trying to drive it back into the ground for your party to finish off, or even cut off the heads of a hydra as pictured below:

            What really won me over with this game was the small but cozy world size, along with the vast amount of customizing options for your gears and your avater's apperanace. There's hundreds of different armors and weapons, and you can enchance them to make them stronger using materials you've collected from monsters and natural resources in the wild!

            Dragon's Dogma's gameplay system takes from both Dark Souls and Shadow Of The Collossus. The large enemies in the game are fun to fight because they're challening and very climbable! The character class mechanics in this game is also something pretty well-thought out.

            The game starts out with you starting in your hometown, a fishman village in the southeast of Gransys: <a href="./Locations/Cassardis.html">Cassardis, in the southwest part of the map below:</a>
