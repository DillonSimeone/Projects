        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>
            1. Basic Design:
            <br>
            The side pictures and the header took me a good bit of time to design. I feel quite proud of those. The header was really interesting to pull together, it's a gif with a static image on top of it. The effect you see is acheived with the Background-blend-mode property in the Css sheet.
        </p>
        <p>
            2. Organization of information
            <br>
            I organizated everything based on how likely it is for the average player to go to those areas first, in their own category.
        </p>
        <p>
            3. Content
            <br>
            This part was unexpectly hard for me. I love Dragon's Dogma, but it turns out that there's not really that much to say about the locations. If this was about the monsters, storyline and the gameplay in Dragon's Dogma, then oh, boy, I could go on for days!
        </p>

            4. Navigation
            <br>
            I had the nav bar below the header, but later found that it crashed with the website design, so I moved it into the header, which seems to be a better place for it, but I still get the sense that I'm missing something about this. Each page's first h1 texts tells the reader their current location on the website.
        </p>

            5. Use of HTML5 and CSS
            <br>
            As I said for number one, this part was my farvoite part! If I had more time, I would had figured out how to make it feel less jarring between the side pictures and the header, somehow. Blurring, maybe? Borders? Box shadow? So many thing could be done, so little time. I did quite a lot with the CSS... The side pictures are done with KeyFrame, so they slowly cycle to different images, and I used a non-javaScript trick in the header and Css sheet to preload the images so there's no lag when the side pictures changes.
