        <h1>Cassardis</h1>
        <p>
            Cassardis is the hero's hometown. It's a very normal village, aside from something that happens at the beginning of the game that sets you on your adventure. There is more than a dozen of villagers in the village, each with their own eachday rounttime. It have a citywall, and a watchtower to ensure that the goblins and wolves outside won't attack the village.

            Cassardis is a very important part of the game in how it gives you access to a few different locations, such as The Black Isles, the Dripstone Cave, and if you've already beaten the game and are now on your new game plus run, a port-stone connected to the UR-dragon's graveyard.
