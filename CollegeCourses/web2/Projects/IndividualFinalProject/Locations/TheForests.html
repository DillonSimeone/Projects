            There are a handful of forests in Dragon's Dogma with something speical about them such as the dead rising when the sun goes down, being the territory of a Chimera, etc.

            What makes Witchwood to stand out from other forests is that it's always covered with thick fog, and have a sleeping golem army scattered across the forest. The witch living in the forest is suspected of creating those sleeping golems as a way to keep her home safe in case an army comes knocking.
        </p>
        <p>
            What most people don't know is that the whole forest is an easter egg. It's a play on the manga, Berserk's witch forest!

            An average forest overan with bandits, expect for one fact: All of the bandits are females trying to go against the system! This forest is also a Chimera's home. The forest becomes one of the most dangerous location in the game after sun down, when the liches and undead knights comes up out of the ground to hunt down the livings.

            A dead forest overflowing with corpses that rises when the sun goes down. The strangest part about this forest is that there's a abbey deep in the heart of the forest.

            This forest is overan with direwolves and bandits to a such degree where most people will get eaten alive by the direwolves when getting mugged by the bandits at the same time, and if they're really unlucky, having their eyes plucked out by the snow harpies.

            In this forest, during the day hobgoblins can be found. Hobgoblins are something between goblins and orcs, being bigger then a goblin but smaller than a orc. A character in the story line's father is buried 
        </p>
        <p>
            At sundown, the hobgoblins disappears and strange light orbs start appearing between the trees. Those are ghosts, defeatable only with magic. They're quite a sight, through!
