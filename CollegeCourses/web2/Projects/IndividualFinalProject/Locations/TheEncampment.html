            This is where most players start to get a idea of the storyline's scope, and start their first large monster battle along with some training to become better at using pawns and fighting creatures.

            What makes this location interesting is the command headquarters, pictured below, where a pawn can be found next to a rift stone. This pawn sells speical things that can only be brought with rift crystals, collected from fell monsters.

            The items he sells makes it possible to customize your character more than at the beginning! Most people end up missing him due to not paying attention. It's worth it to talk to him when you have some rift crystals to spend.
