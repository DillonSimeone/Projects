            There's a handful of "Dungeons" in the game too. Those are maps apart of the overworld map and the city or villages other than Bluemoon, Black Isles and the Everfall.

            The tainted mountain divides the kingdom into west and east region. It used to be a city, but after countless cycles of heroes battling the dragon over and over, the city fell to ruins due to the dragon's overwhelming strength.

            A deep canyon home to many kinds of monsters such as cockatrics, cyclops, harpies, etc. This canyon is very dangerous due to the long drop that awaits the reckless adventurer. The harpies enjoy grabbing people then throwing them off the cliffs.
