        <h1>The Wild</h1>
        <p>
            Strange things can be seen wandering around on the plains outside of the forest, such as invisible lizard people, trolls, and even dragons if you're a unlucky traveller.

            One of the nicer places in the game. It is clear that the trails was handmade carefully to be pleasing as possible.

            One of my farvoite places in the game because you can see the captial city if you climb to the top, along with most of the kingdoms.

            A healing spring can be found in the area, along with the Windbluff Tower. At night time, phantoms can also be seen floating inbetween the bones of the hungry skeleton armies that rises after sundown.

            The only way you can reach the bluemoon tower, which can be seen from nearly everywhere in the kingdom, is to pass through the valley, which is overan with harpies and bandits. The bandits in the area have set up copious chokepoints to catch their victims.

            The plains just outside of the captial city. As expected, at sundown, the undead rises. However, one odd thing to notice is a dead cult appears along with the undead, creating more undeads and trying to destroy the captial city from the inside-out.

            Shadowed by the massive shadow fort, this small grove is the home of various goblins that've tunneled their way under the fort from the froniters. A drake lives in the grove, most likely eating the goblins.

            The crags is just before the tainted mountain. It's filled with poisonious water flowing from the mountains, and direwolves, goblins, large creatures, lizards, harpies and ghosts. The ghosts wander around the poisoned waters, they're assumely the poor souls of the creatures that died of poisoning. They're more dangerous than other ghosts in how they will easily pull pawns into the rift, ending their life right away.
