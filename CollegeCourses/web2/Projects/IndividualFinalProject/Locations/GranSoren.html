            All of the roads in Dragon's Dogma leads to this place, the kingdom's captial. Many services such as hair-cutting, forgery-making, armor and weapon stores, etc can be found in this city.

            A interesting fact about the city is that no pawns are allowed into the grounds of the castle where the kingdom's duke lives. There's also a place called the everfall below the farm lands within the walls, which is treasured by the pawns.

            Sadly, there is no map for this location that explains all of the places within the city well enough to be included in this page.
