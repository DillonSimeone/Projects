	<h1>Chapter 5</h1>

	<h2>File system security (access rights)</h2>

	<p>In your unixstuff directory, type the following.</p>

	<div class="boxed">ls -l (l for long listing!)</div>

	<p>You will see that you now get lots of details about the contents of your directory<sup>1</sup>.</p>

	<p>Each file (and directory) has associated access rights, which may be found by typing ls -l. 
	Also, ls -lg gives additional information as to which group owns the file<sup>1</sup> (beng95 in the following example).</p>

	<p><span class = "bold">"-rwxrw-r-- 1 ee51ab beng95 2450 Sept29 11:52 file1" </span></p>

	<p>In the left-hand column is a 10 symbol string consisting of the symbols d, r, w, x, -, and, occasionally, s or S. If d is present, 
	it will be at the left hand end of the string, and indicates a directory: otherwise - will be the starting symbol of the string.
	The 9 remaining symbols indicate the permissions, or access rights, and are taken as three groups of 3<sup>1</sup>.</p>

	<p>The left group of 3 gives the file permissions for the user that owns the file (or directory) (ee51ab in the above example);<br/>
	the middle group gives the permissions for the group of people to whom the file (or directory) belongs (eebeng95 in the above example);<br/>
	the rightmost group gives the permissions for all others<sup>1</sup>.</p>

	<h3>Access rights on files.</h3>

	<p>
		r (or -), indicates read permission (or otherwise), that is, the presence or absence of permission to read and copy the file <br/>
		w (or -), indicates write permission (or otherwise), that is, the permission (or otherwise) to change a file <br/>
		x (or -), indicates execution permission (or otherwise), that is, the permission to execute a file, where appropriate<sup>1</sup>.
	</p>

	<h3>Access rights on directories.</h3>

	<p>"r allows users to list files in the directory; <br/>
	w means that users may delete files from the directory or move files into it; <br/>
	x means the right to access files in the directory. This implies that you may read files 
	in the directory provided you have read permission on the individual files<sup>1</sup>.</p>

	<p>So, in order to read a file, you must have execute permission on the directory containing 
	that file<sup>1</sup>, and hence on any directory containing that directory as a subdirectory, and so on, 
	up the tree.</p>

	<h3>Some examples</h3>

	<div class="boxed">-rwxrwxrwx</div>
	<p>fa file that everyone can read, write and execute (and delete)"<sup>1</sup>.</p>
	
	<div class="boxed">-rw-------</div>
	<p>a file that only the owner can read and write - no-one else can read or write and no-one has execution rights (e.g. your mailbox file)" <sup>1</sup>.</p>

	<h2>Changing access rights</h2>
	<h3>chmod (changing a file mode)</h3>

	<p>Only the owner of a file can use chmod to change the permissions of a file. 
	The options of chmod are as follows.</p>

	<table>

		<tr>
			<th>Symbol</th>
			<th>Meaning</th>
		</tr>

		<tr>
			<td>u</td>   
			<td>user</td>
		</tr>

		<tr>
			<td>g</td> 
			<td>group</td>
		</tr>

		<tr>
			<td>o</td>
			<td>other</td>
		</tr>

		<tr>
			<td>a</td>
			<td>all</td>            
		</tr>

		<tr>
			<td>r</td>
			<td>read</td>
		</tr>

		<tr>
			<td>w</td> 
			<td>"write (and delete)" (Source: UNIX Tutorial Five).</td>
		</tr>

		<tr>
			<td>x</td>
			<td>"execute (and access directory)" (Source: UNIX Tutorial Five).</td>
		</tr>

		<tr>
			<td>+</td>
			<td>"add permission" (Source: UNIX Tutorial Five).</td>
		</tr>

		<tr>
			<td>-</td>
			<td>"take away permission" (Source: UNIX Tutorial Five).</td>
		</tr>

	</table>

	<p>For example, to remove read write and execute permissions on the file biglist for the group and others, type the following.</p>

	<div class="boxed">chmod go-rwx biglist</div>

	<p>This will leave the other permissions unaffected‚Äù (Source: UNIX Tutorial Five)
	To give read and write permissions on the file biglist to all<sup>1</sup>.</p>

	<div class="boxed">chmod a+rw biglist</div>     

	<h2>Processes and Jobs</h2>

	<p>A process is an executing program identified by a unique PID (process identifier)<sup>1</sup>. 
	To see information about your processes, with their associated PID and status, type the following.</p>

	<div class="boxed">ps</div>

	<p>A process may be in the foreground, in the background, or be suspended. 
	In general the shell does not return the UNIX prompt until the current process has finished executing<sup>1</sup>.
	Some processes take a long time to run and hold up the terminal. Backgrounding a long process has the effect that the 
	UNIX prompt is returned immediately, and other tasks can be carried out while the original process continues executing.</p>

	<h3>Running background processes</h3>

	<p>To background a process, type an & at the end of the command line. For example, the command sleep waits a given number of seconds before continuing. Type the following.</p>

	<div class="boxed">sleep 10</div>

	<p>This will wait 10 seconds before returning the command prompt %. Until the command prompt is returned, you can do nothing except wait<sup>1</sup>.
	To run sleep in the background, type the following.</p>

	<div class="boxed">sleep 10 &</div>

	<div class = "boxed">[1] 6259</div>

	<p>The & runs the job in the background and returns the prompt straight away, allowing you do run other programs 
	while waiting for that one to finish<sup>1</sup>.
	The first line in the above example is typed in by the user; the next line, indicating job number and PID, is returned by the machine. 
	The user is be notified of a job number (numbered from 1) enclosed in square brackets, together with a PID and is notified when a background 
	process is finished. Backgrounding is useful for jobs which will take a long time to complete<sup>1</sup>.</p>

	<h3>Backgrounding a current foreground process</h3>

	<p>At the prompt, type the following.</p>
	
	<div class="boxed">sleep 1000</div>

	<p>You can suspend the process running in the foreground by typing ^Z, i.e.hold down the [Ctrl] key and type [z]<sup>1</sup>. Then to put it in the background, type the following.</p>

	<div class="boxed">bg</div>

	<p><span class = "bold">Note: </span>do not background programs that require user interaction e.g. vi</p>

	<h2>Listing suspended and background processes</h2>

	<p>When a process is running, backgrounded or suspended, it will be entered onto a list along with a job number<sup>1</sup>.  
	To examine this list, type the following.</p>

	<div class="boxed">jobs</div>

	<p>"An example of a job list could be" (Source: UNIX Tutorial Five).</p>

	<div class = "boxed">[1] Suspended sleep 1000<br/>
                      [2] Running netscape<br/>
                      [3] Running matlab</div>

	<p>To restart (foreground) a suspended processes, type the following.</p>

	<div class="boxed">fg %jobnumber</div>

	<p>For example, to restart sleep 1000, type the following.</p>

	<div class="boxed">fg %1</div>

	<p>Typing fg with no job number foregrounds the last suspended process<sup>1</sup>.</p>

	<h2>Killing a process</h2>
	<h3>kill (terminate or signal a process)</h3>

	<p>It is sometimes necessary to kill a process (for example, when an executing program is in an infinite loop)<sup>1</sup>>.
	To kill a job running in the foreground, type ^C (control c)<sup>1</sup>. For example, run the following.</p>

	<div class="boxed">sleep 100 <br/>^C</div>

	<p>To kill a suspended or background process, type the following.</p>

	<div class="boxed">kill %jobnumber</div>

	<p>For example, run the following.</p>

	<div class="boxed">sleep 100 & <br/> jobs</div>

	<p>If it is job number 4, type the following.</p>

	<div class="boxed">kill %4</div>

	<p>To check whether this has worked, examine the job list again to see if the process has been removed. </p>

	<h3>ps (process status)</h3>

	<p>Alternatively, processes can be killed by finding their process numbers (PIDs) and using kill PID_number<sup>1</sup>.</p>

	<div class="boxed">sleep 1000 & <br/> ps</div>

	<div class = "boxed">
		PID TT S TIME COMMAND<br/>
        20077 pts/5 S 0:05 sleep 1000<br/>
        21563 pts/5 T 0:00 netscape<br/>
        21873 pts/5 S 0:25 nedit</div>

	<p>To kill off the process sleep 1000, type the following.</p>

	<div class="boxed">kill 20077</div>

	<p>and then type ps again to see if it has been removed from the list.
	If a process refuses to be killed, uses the -9 option, i.e. type the following<sup>1</sup>.</p>

	<div class="boxed">kill -9 20077</div>

	<p><span class = "bold">Note: </span>It is not possible to kill off other users' processes!!!</p>
