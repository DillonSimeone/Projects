        <p>Life have taught me to be patient, and mindful of the time I have. There's only so many hours in a day that you can be productive during. I grew up to be happy with what I have, not what I could have. My motto is: "The greenest grass is the grass you water."</p>
        <p>My interests are very diverse. Programming, rock-climbing, building a robot, hiking and camping, hunting, video games, movies, books, writing, and many others. I've always believed that a idling mind is a dying mind.</p>
        <p>My favorite story: <a href="https://parahumans.wordpress.com/table-of-contents/">Worm</a>. I like Worm because it's a very grim story with the best ending I've ever read in a book before. That's remarkable, because I read a lot. Normally, a story of Worm's scope would take a person a month or two to read. It took me about a week to read it from cover to cover.</p>
        <p>My farvoite game: <a href="http://www.dragonsdogma.com/agegate.php">Dragon's Dogma</a>. This game is really unique, one of those games that proves that you shouldn't judge them by their covers. At a glance, the game comes across as an average hack and slash game. It's so much more than that, the story line, the twists, how the classes was crafted, the low-key graphic. This game, for me, hits all of the important marks in a proper game without overdoing or underdoing it.</p>
        <p>My farvoite movie: <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2397535/">Predestination</a>. This is one of those movies that shouldn't be judged by the cover. It's diffcult to explain how the movie is good without giving away the element that makes the movie so horrifying. It starts out slow, but at the halfpoint, you will find yourself glued to your chair.</p>
