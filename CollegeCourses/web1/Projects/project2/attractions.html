        Upon entering the eyes of the hurriances in Kansas, either voluntarily or involuntarily, visitors are transported to the beginning of the red road by the witch of the west, and the witch will explain the rules and the reward for overcoming Oz before the Oz's games starts. In Kansas, no one ever die as a result of hurranice, only forever trapped in Oz upon losing the game.

            Four of Oz's main features are as follows:
