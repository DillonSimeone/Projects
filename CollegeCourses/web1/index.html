            <h1>Web 1</h1>
            <p>It have a few years since I looked at any of my Web 1 course stuff at the time of this web page's creation. A quite bit is missing, I believe, however, that's not a big issue since they was all very basic stuff. Nothing that anyone would be interested in, aside from my projects.</p>
